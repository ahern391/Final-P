        premium leather made from Jawas and if you get cold, you may request a
        blanket of ewok fur. A cozy perfect interrior for all the family while
        cruising on deep space. The best part of it all, right outside your door
        is a perfect view of Alderaan unless Lord Sidious decides to make it go

      <body class="text-3xl mx-auto text-center m-16 tracking-wider font-thin">
        Room C or the Anikin suite, is created by the dark lord himself. The color
        and taste of the room is inspired by the years of child hood from Darth
        Vader himself. The warm lights prove to be very mood setting to remind of
        us that light side of the force is welcoming. Disregard that, anyway the
        suite comes a katichen as well should you need cook your self some Colo
        Claw Fish or Roasted Porg.
