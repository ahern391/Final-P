      A Death Star was a moon-sized Imperial military battlestation armed with a
      planet-destroying superlaser. The Death Star, whose concept had been
      explored even before the Clone Wars, was the first in a long series of
      superweapons developed to execute the Tarkin Doctrine. The Death Star was
      designed to allow Emperor Palpatine to more directly control the Galactic
      Empire through fear. In most instances, a Death Star was to be commanded by
      a Moff.
